# Introduction #

This page will provide a brief overview of commercially available devices that monitor physical activities. We will also try to include all possible technologies used in these devices. Many of these devices can be effectively used in metabolic assessment, behavior therapy, and weight management, becoming an essential part of the solution to diabetes, obesity and chronic diseases.
Characteristics of physical activity are indicative of one’s mobility level, latent chronic diseases and aging process.

# Why do we need PA monitoring? #

  * Surveillance:
PA monitoring can be used to monitor the working habits of one's employees and based on the analysis, problems can be identified and can be sorted out too.

  * Health:
Amount of daily physical activity directly influences the health condition and quality of life. Accurate monitoring of physical activities and energy expenditure are important to keep ourselves healthy. PA monitors can be used to keep a track of a patient's medical condition and can be helpful in diagnosis too.

  * Customization of Products:
Data collected from PA monitors can be used for finding patterns in a user's activity and depending on it products can be customized for better user satisfaction and convenience.

# Properties of PA monitors #
  1. Very light in weight
  1. Absolutely Non-invasive
  1. Compatible with daily activities
  1. Able to present the recorded data in an understandable and useful way
  1. Easy to calibrate

# Basic Steps Involved in a PA Monitor #

  * Sensing

  * Data Storage

  * Data Analysis

  * Data Representation

# Types of Sensors for Physical Activity Monitoring #

Physical activity is mostly monitored by using Motion Sensors.

  * Accelerometers

  * Pedometers

  * Gyroscopes

  * Heart Rate Monitors

# Accelerometers as Motion sensors #
Accelerometers are sensors which measure the accelerations of objects in motion along reference axes.
They consists of a seismic mass attached to a mechanical suspension system with respect to a reference frame.
Force due to acceleration causes the mass to deflect according to Newton’s Second Law.
Acceleration can be measured electrically with the physical changes in displacement of the proof mass with respect to the reference frame.

# Types of Accelerometers used #
  * **Piezoresistive  accelerometers**:  The  change  in  electric resistance is proportion to applied mechanical stress.
  * **Piezoelectric  accelerometers**:  The  sensing  element bends  due  to  applied  acceleration  which  causes  a displacement  of  the  seismic  mass,  and  results  in  an output  voltage  proportional  to  the  applied acceleration.
  * **Differential  capacitive  accelerometers**:  In  a  capacitive sensing mechanism,  the  seismic mass  is  encapsulated between two electrodes. The differential capacitance is proportional  to  the  deflection  of  the  seismic  mass between the two electrodes.

# Pedometers as Motion sensors #
  * Pedometers counts the number of steps taken by detecting the motion of a person’s waist region.
  * Pedometers can be of many types:
    * Spring‐suspended lever arm with metal‐on‐metal contact.
    * Pendulum
  * The sensing devices move in response to body’s vertical accelerations, opening and closing an internal electrical circuit. The step‐counter increases each time when the circuit is open/closed.

# Gyroscopes as Motion Sensors #
  * It detects change in angular motion about one or many axis.
  * Used for measuring orientation, based on the principle of conservation of angular momentum.
  * Measures change in posture.

# Heart Rate Monitor #
  * Allows a user to measure his/her heart rate in real time.
  * Consists of a chest strap transmitter and a wrist receiver.
  * Strapless heart rate monitors now allow the user to just touch two sensors on a wristwatch display for a few seconds to view their heart rate.
  * Includes a microprocessor which continuously monitors the EKG (Electrocardiogram) and calculates the heart rate.

# Working of EKG Sensor #
  * Heart generates electrical impulses as it beats.
  * By using a few electrical pickups and an amplifier circuit, EKG detects the heart’s electrical impulses on the skin.

# Placement of Sensors #
The following  places are used for placing PAM sensors:
  1. Pockets or  bag
  1. Inside the Shoe
  1. Certain places on the human body:
    * Wrist,
    * Thigh,
    * Chest,
    * Torso etc.
> > (known as “wearable” regions)

# Data Storage #
Important to collect the activity data to enable the user to study his/her behavior.

  * Internal Memory Only
  * Portable Data
  * Transient  Data

# Application: Posture and Movement Classification #
  * Step Counter:  Most basic measurement and used as a basis to calculate more complex data. Pedometers are the best for counting number of steps.
  * Tilt Sensing: Postures such as standing and lying can be distinguished by the use of only one accelerometer.
  * Standing and sitting postures can be distinguished by using multiple accelerometers or with the use of a gyroscope.

# Application: Calculating Energy Expenditure #

  * Some pedometers estimate calorie consumption during walking by multiplying number of steps with an energy coefficient.
  * This coefficient is determined by the gender and the age of the user.
  * For more precision, a accelerometer can be used to distinguishingly classify the action and then calculate the energy expenditure.

# Research Experiment (1) #
A System for Continuous Monitoring of Breathing and Kinetic Activity
  * Consists of a breathing sensor and an accelerometer.
  * For breathing sensing, a dilation sensor is used based on a conductive rubber.
  * To observe the changes in breathing rate with the amount of physical motion, an accelerometer was used to detect the kinetic activity of the person.
  * Experimental results showed a clear correlation between breathing rate and kinetic activity.

# Research Experiment (2): #
Using Sensor Networks to Measure Intensity in Sporting Activities: Consists of a breathing sensor and an accelerometer.
  * Experiment done on all the  players of two teams playing a football game.
  * Sensors monitoring heart rate continuously throughout the game.
  * Correlated the data between the match timings and the values from the monitor.
