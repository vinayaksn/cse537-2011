#summary A Mesh Network using ZigBee for sensory data
ZigBee is a specification for a suite of high level communication protocols using small, low-power digital radios based on the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standard for Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPANs), such as wireless light switches with lamps, electrical meters with in-home-displays, consumer electronics equipment via short-range radio needing low rates of data transfer.

Mesh networking (topology) is a type of networking where each node must not only capture and disseminate its own data, but also serve as a relay for other sensor nodes, that is, it must collaborate to propagate the data in the network.

*Introduction*

In this Project we will form a Mesh network of ZigBee Nodes which will used to pass sensory data from multiple node to Master Node. Each Zigbee node will be interfaced with sensors. Sensory data collected from these nodes will pass to Master Node using this mesh network.

=Objectives=
  * Make a point to multipoint and mesh network of ZigBee nodes.
  * Configuring ZigBee coordinator and router
  * Interfacing sensors (temperature or motion) to each node and deploy the network and collecting data.
  * Collecting and plotting the data


=So far...=
==Point to multi-point==
  * Configure a multi-point to to master node.
  * Configure the ADCs in ZigBee node
  * Configuring ZigBee coordinator and router
  * Interfacing sensors (temperature or motion) to each node and deploy the network and collecting data.
  * Collecting and plotting the data
