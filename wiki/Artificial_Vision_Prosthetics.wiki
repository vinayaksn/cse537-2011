==The Biological Eye==
To appreciate and understand the ideas behind bionic eye, it is necessary to know the basics of the biological eye. Atleast knowledge about the basic working of the biological eye and the main actors inside it, is vital.Though it appears a daunting task, specially for a IT student, to read(leave aside understanding)a page of medical science, the structure of eye and its basics are quite easy to grasp. 
  

Light reflected from the object enters the eye through the cornea and is projected onto the retina by the lens.The retina senses the light and sends signals to the brain through the optical nerve.The brain,finally, interprets the signals to give form to the scene.
Retina is a thin membrane at the end of the eye and its function is to receive light and transmit signals to the brain.Three types of cells are present inside retina:-
 # Rods
 # Cones
 # Ganglion cells

Rods and cones are the photoreceptors.While rods function in low levels of light and are responsible for the black and white sensing of scene, the cones are responsible to fill the color in the scene and provide high resolution to the view.The *Ganglion cells* receive the information from *rods and cones* , interprets it and send corresponding signals to the *visual cortex* in the brain through the *optic nerve*.


==The Bionic Eye==
The origin of the field of Artificial Vision dates back to 1929 when Foerster a German neurosurgeon demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the visual cortex could lead to the perception of light spots by the subject.The field further received a jolt when Dr Mark Humayun demonstrated that a blind person could be made to see light by stimulating the Ganglion cells with an electrical current.These developments implied that the communications between different parts of the visual system, can be electrically simulated hence exposing possibility to bypass the affected part of eye by directly stimulating the healthy part. 

In the functioning of the eye described above, the problem can arise at either the retina where the retinal cells ( rods,cones,ganglion cells) are rendered inoperative or the optic nerve may be affected.Depending upon the affected part of visual system,research is currently undergoing in three areas trying to bypass the affected part:-

 # Retinal Prosthesis - Bypasses rods and cones to directly stimulate the ganglion cells.
 # Optic Nerve Prosthesis - Bypasses the whole retina to directly stimulate the optic nerve.
 # Cortical Prosthesis - Directly stimulates the visual cortex , bypassing whole visual system before cortex - retina,optic nerve.








Retinitis Pigmentosa(RP) and Age Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) are two leading causes of vision loss.1.5 million people are affected with RP world wide while 700,000 new cases of AMD are diagnosed annually in US.Both these disease affect the retina and render the rods and cones inoperative.However these diseases do not affect the ganglion cells and the optic nerve.This means that if the function of rods and cones can be artificially performed, the information could still be sent to brain for interpretation.
