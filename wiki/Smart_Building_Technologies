Introduction:
A smart building is the integration of building, technology, and energy systems. These
systems may include building automation, life safety, telecommunications, user systems
and facility management systems. Smart buildings recognize and reflect the technological
advancements and convergence of building systems, the common elements of the systems
and the additional functionality that integrated systems provide. Smart buildings provide
actionable information about a building or space within a building to allow the building
owner or occupant to manage the building or space.

Smart buildings provide the most cost effective approach to the design and the
deployment of building technology systems. The traditional way to design and construct
a building is to design, install, and operate each system separately. A smart building takes
a different approach and integrates the design and installation of the systems. This
process reduces the inefficiencies in the design and construction process, saving time and
money.
