Electrocardiogram(ECG) using Atmega328p micro controller.

= Introduction =

The system is intended to detect and display the small voltages generated by human heart in the form P wave, QRS complex, T wave & U wave in case of reading normal healthy heart .
To measure the ECG we connect two electrodes on the right and left chest of the person respectively.And, we connect the ground of the circuit to the leg of the person through electrode. The two electrodes connected to the chest works as two inputs of the differential amplifiers, the output of this amplifier is then fed to analog to digital converter. This ADC value is then continuously sent to computer through serial interface and displayed as electrocardiograph


= Hardware Required =

a) Micro-controller 328p is required to convert analog to digital values and to send values to host machine for processing the data.

b) Electrodes to obtain voltages generated by the human heart.

c) Switched Voltage converter (LTC1044).(to send supply to AD620).

d) Instrumentation amplifier (AD620) to amplify the ECG voltages obtained from electrodes.

e) Operational amplifier (OP97) is connected as source follower.

= Software Required =

a) Arduino IDE 

b) Processing
