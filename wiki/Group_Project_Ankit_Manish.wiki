#summary Electrocardiogram(ECG) using Atmega328p micro controller.

= ELECTROCARDIOGRAM = 
== Introduction ==

The system is intended to detect and display the small voltages generated by human heart in the form P wave, QRS complex, T wave & U wave in case of reading normal healthy heart.
To measure the ECG we connect two electrodes on the right and left chest of the person respectively.And, we connect the ground of the circuit to the leg of the person through electrode. The two electrodes connected to the chest works as two inputs of the differential amplifiers, the output of this amplifier is then fed to analog to digital converter. This ADC value is then continuously sent to computer through serial interface and displayed as electrocardiograph.


== Hardware Required ==

a) Micro-controller 328p is required to convert analog to digital values and to send values to host machine for processing the data.

b) Electrodes to obtain voltages generated by the human heart.

c) 4-5 operational amplifiers i.e LF353N ,resistors 100K and 10K.



== Software Required ==

a) Arduino IDE

b) Require to develop a serial port monitor which can plot the data being sent from serial port in real time.

== Progress So Far ==

*Week 1*

  * Installation of necessary software has been done as well as   familiarity of various softwares like Processing(An open-source serial monitor) has been built.

  * Some examples of plotting analog values received at one of the port of the host system have been attempted.

*Week 2*

  * Read about basics of ECG. For example,how voltages are generated from body ,different ways of measuring, amplifying it and representing these voltages as wave.

  * Went through different circuits available online to amplify low range differential voltages from the body.

  * Due to non-availability of some components circuit selected to try out the things :

*Week 3*

  * Developed the analog amplifying circuit and tested it.
  * Developed the system software to read serial data, plot it and save it as an ECG.


*Issues Faced*

 * Availability of components of specific values like Resistors, capacitors.

 * Differential voltages from body is in range of -5mV to +5mV. Due to long unshielded wires, a lot of noise was introduced in the signals. Making it difficult to infer the readings and pulses.


* Present work * 
  * Circuit with shielded wires to reduce noise is currently under testing. .
* Results *
  * Following results are obtained from testing.

  * Readings shows variation in body signals in range of 0-25mV.
