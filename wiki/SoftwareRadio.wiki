Software Radio, also known as software-defined radio, is a software problem of building radio components(eg. mixer, detector, modulator/demodulator etc)with the help of software instead of hardware.Typically, the main aim is to diminish the hardware gap between the software and the antennae, as much as doable, by dissolving the RF hardware in between.

= Introduction =
Radio devices are almost everywhere around us like FM radios, mobile phones, home automation devices like gate openers & so many others. The motivation behind the software radio approach is that different radio devices can not talk to each other but the software can reconfigure devices on the fly so that they can talk and listen to multiple channels. Which helps us to make out the full utilization of the radio frequency of the electronic spectrum.

= Purpose of RF front-end = 
 Of the two sections of transceiver i.e transmitter and receiver , receiver is the most complex and important focus of this approach. The role of receiver is to isolate the incoming signal from external noise and interference for demodulation and further processing.The basic function is to filter out unwanted signal and condition the desired signal for digital processing. This involves extracting signal from antennae, filter it to remove undesired signal, converting signal to an amplitude compatible with the Analog to digital conversion process and finally feeding it to analog to digital converter.

= Reciever Design and issues =
 
 The ideal concept to software radio approach would be to attach an anlog-to digital converter with the antennae. The digital signal processor would read the converter, and then its software would transform the stream of data from the converter to any other form the application requires. 
As, the original analog-to-digital converters would not be able to pick a very low power signal (nano-watt, or micro-watt), it should be preceded by a low-noise amplifier in the conversion step. But, these amplifiers introduces problems like if some harmonics, outside the range assigned to transmitter are present in the recieved signal, then these may compete with the desired signal within the dynamic range.This may introduce distortion in the desired signal or may block it.
The solution would be to put band-pass filters b/w antenna and amplifier, but that may reduce the flexibility of the radio-which is considered to be main point of software radio.
