#summary Shows how micro-controllers help efficient use of battery in hybrid and electric vehicles.
= Introduction =
Electric and Hybrid electric vehicles are increasing in popularity and demand due to the rising fuel prices and concerns towards the rising CO,,2,, content in the atmosphere as world is more aware.
Consumers are embracing environmentally friendly "green cars" as a result of the rising cost of fossil fuels and a growing concern for the health of the environment. 
Sales forecasts predict that green car sales will comprise 20%â€“25% of all vehicle sales by the year 2015.
The hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is quickly becoming the most popular green car and by 2015 is expected to comprise approximately 12% of global vehicle sales.
Another class of cars that are growing are electric cars which right now are low in number but is going to be the thing to turn to after fuel becomes scarce for Hybrid vehicles as these solely run on the battery and hence battery management is an even bigger task here.
Hybrid electric vehicles employ complex power electronic circuitry to control the flow of electric energy through the vehicle.

Examples of such cars are:
 # Toyota Prius
 # Honda Civic
 # Honda Insight
 # Honda Accord
 # Ford Escape


There are  a number of factors affecting batteries in vehicle hence it is important to have effecient battery management. The facetors affecting battery life are :
 # Temperature :Temperature has severe affects on battery performance and these affects depend greatly on the battery chemistry used. A rule of thumb for temperature degradation is                 that battery performance will decrease by 35% at either the upper or lower range of the specified operating threshold, outside the threshold the battery may not                     work at all.
 # DOD(Depth of Discharge) : The rate at which the battery is discharged and for how long also affects the battery life.
 # Charging: The level of charging, the voltage at which the battery is charged and for how long at a stretch also affects the battery as charging the battery for too long might                   damage it and other such factors.
 # Voltage affects : Rechargeable batteries each have a characteristic working voltage range associated with the particular cell chemistry employed. The practical voltage limits                   are a consequence of the onset of undesirable chemical reactions which take place beyond the safe working range.
 # Other factors : factors like cell ageing,weather,usage, maintainance etc also affect the battery and these should also be catered to.
