#summary Efficient battery management in Hybrid Electric vehicles.
= Introduction =
Electric and Hybrid electric vehicles are increasing in popularity and demand due to the rising fuel prices and concerns towards the rising CO,,2,, content in the atmosphere as world is more aware.
Consumers are embracing environmentally friendly "green cars" as a result of the rising cost of fossil fuels and a growing concern for the health of the environment. 
Sales forecasts predict that green car sales will comprise 20%â€“25% of all vehicle sales by the year 2015.
The hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is quickly becoming the most popular green car and by 2015 is expected to comprise approximately 12% of global vehicle sales.
Another class of cars that are growing are electric cars which right now are low in number but is going to be the thing to turn to after fuel becomes scarce for Hybrid vehicles as these solely run on the battery and hence battery management is an even bigger task here.
Hybrid electric vehicles employ complex power electronic circuitry to control the flow of electric energy through the vehicle.

Examples of such cars are:
 # Toyota Prius
 # Honda Civic
 # Honda Insight
 # Honda Accord
 # Ford Escape

 In order to address the problems of 

 # Rising fuel prices
 # Global Warming
 # Pollution 

 the Electric Vehicles(EVs) came into existence. But they are still unable to penetrate into the consumer market. One of the major reason of the lack of acceptance of EVs powered by battery could be the presence of only 1 source of power i.e. battery, which makes it less usable as even the advanced battery system could only support 140 to 150 kms at one go. So after every 100 to 150 kms you need to recharge your battery overnight and due to low of number of recharging stations, you can't rely only on the battery powered vehicle for long distance travel. 
= Factors Affecting Battery Performance =
There are  a number of factors affecting batteries in vehicle hence it is important to have effecient battery management. The factors affecting battery life are :
 # _Temperature_ :Temperature has severe affects on battery performance and these affects depend greatly on the battery chemistry used. A rule of thumb for temperature degradation is that battery performance will decrease by 35% at either the upper or lower range of the specified operating threshold, outside the threshold the battery may not                     work at all.
 # _DOD(Depth of Discharge)_ : The rate at which the battery is discharged and for how long also affects the battery life.
 # _Charging_: The level of charging, the voltage at which the battery is charged and for how long at a stretch also affects the battery as charging the battery for too long might damage it and other such factors.
 # _Voltage affects_ : Rechargeable batteries each have a characteristic working voltage range associated with the particular cell chemistry employed. The practical voltage limits are a consequence of the onset of undesirable chemical reactions which take place beyond the safe working range.
 # _Power to weight ratio_ : The battery capacity also depends on the weight of the vehicle as we need more and more powerful batteries for heavier vehicles.
 # _Other factors_ : factors like cell ageing, weather, usage, maintainance, etc. also affect the battery and these should also be catered to.
