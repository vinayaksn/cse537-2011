#summary Shows how micro-controllers help efficient use of battery in hybrid and electric vehicles.
= Introduction =
Electric and Hybrid electric vehicles are increasing in popularity and demand due to the rising fuel prices and concerns towards the rising CO,,2,, content in the atmosphere as world is more aware.
Consumers are embracing environmentally friendly "green cars" as a result of the rising cost of fossil fuels and a growing concern for the health of the environment. 
Sales forecasts predict that green car sales will comprise 20%â€“25% of all vehicle sales by the year 2015.
The hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is quickly becoming the most popular green car and by 2015 is expected to comprise approximately 12% of global vehicle sales.
Another class of cars that are growing are electric cars which right now are low in number but is going to be the thing to turn to after fuel becomes scarce for Hybrid vehicles as these solely run on the battery and hence battery management is an even bigger task here.
Hybrid electric vehicles employ complex power electronic circuitry to control the flow of electric energy through the vehicle.

Examples of such cars are:
 # Toyota Prius
 # Honda Civic
 # Honda Insight
 # Honda Accord
 # Ford Escape
