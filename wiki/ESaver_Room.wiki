#summary This wiki page describes the details about the ESaver Room project.

= Introduction =

We all waste a lot of power throughout the day due to our carelessness when we don't turn off the small things like fans, lights, ACs etc when we leave the room. How about making a smarter room which can automatically switch off the equipments if there is nobody inside the room and switch them on when somebody enters the room. This project describes how we can use a micro-controller to upgrade our room into a smart electricity saving room.

= Hardware required =
The following are the hardware required:                                
 # IR sensors
 # Relays
Two types of relay will be used - 5A and 15A for fan and AC
 # Ethernet shield
 # Current sensor
 # ATmega328 microcontroller
 # PIR sensor
 # contact sensor

= Hardware Functionality =

1. IR sensors: the sensors help to identify the presence of number of people entering or leaving the room.

2. Relays: it will be used to operate all the lights and fans in the room.

3. Ethernet Shield: it will be used to inform the user over the internet about the status of the electricity usage in the room.

4. Current Sensor: it will be used to measure the total electricity usage in the room.

5. LCD: To display the number of people in the room.

6. Contact sensor: tells when the door is opened.

= Steps =

1.Increment the count when someone enters the room. This will be done by the IR sensors. (Done)

2.If the count is greater than 0 i.e. there is one or more people in the room turn on all of the appliances. (Done) 

3.If the count is equal to 0 i.e. there is no one in the room turn off all of the appliances. (Done) 

4.The current sensors measure the current consumption in all the devices, through which we can calculate the energy saved. (To be done)

5.Through the Ethernet shield send the collected data to the computer, where it can be hoisted on the web. (To be done)

= Project Demo =

When somebody enters into the room then the counter is incremented by one and the light and other appliances in the room will be switched ON and when any one leaves the room then the counter is decremented by one.
 
The light will be only switched OFF until all the persons in the room go out. The total number of persons inside the room is also displayed on the LCD. 

The microcontroller with the help of relay does the above job. It receives the signals from the IR sensors, and this signal is operated under the control of software, which is stored in ROM.

Microcontroller ATmega328P continuously monitors the Infrared Receivers, When any object passes through the IR Receiver's then the IR Rays falling on the receivers are obstructed , this obstruction is sensed by the Microcontroller and the counter is incremented or decremented accordingly.

Further current sensors will be used to monitor the current usage and then ethernet shield will be used to send this data on to the net so that the user can view the usage log(functionality of smart meter).
