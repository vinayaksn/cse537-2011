=Medical Sensing Technologies=
Medical sensing technology incorporates the field where sensors are used in the medical diagnosis through sensing. These sensors can either 
	* interpret the alredy present electrical signals inside our body or
	* transduce the bio-chemical activities into an electrical signal.
Some examples of the first kind of sensors involve ECG and EEG.Both these techniques sense and calibrate
the electrical signals that takes place inside our body like the electrical activity of the brain (in the form of brain waves or pulses of the heart).

The second kind of sensors work at the bio-chemical level where they have to transduce a biological activity into an electrical signal.These sensors are called biosensors.These are the principal medium in the field of medical sensing.
==Biosensors==
A biosensor typically comprises of five steps.These are
	* Biological reaction.
		* A conversion of a substrate into product which either directly or indirectly measures the 			event that is to be measured.
	* A transducer.
		* This can be said to be the most significant portion of a biosensor.This is what maps the 			reaction mentioned in step 1 to an electrical signal.
	* Amplification
		* The signal produced in the above step is typically weak and needs to be amplified.
	* Processing & Display
		* The resulting electric signal is then processed into a meaningful and understandable value 		which can be read by the user

==History==
The biggest commercial success of medical sensing was Blood glucose monitoring which allowed sensing of the blood glucose level of a person. This is done through blood glucose meters which are essentially biosensors in themselves.The reaction of a small drop of blood with A chemically active strip is interfaced with the digital meter which reacts with a small amount of blood taken from the patient's finger.The recieved data is then processed and displayed on the meter.
 The sensing technology used is obviously chemical in nature but different techniques are being worked at which are aimed at removing the need to take blood from the patient.These techniques are termed as non-invasive technology or minimal noninvasive technologies.

==Use of Nanotechnology==
The emergence of nanotechnology has the potential of making many fields (including computers) revelutionary.Biosensors are no exception. Nanotechnology allows biosensors to be much more smaller and much more specific.These sensors are termed as nanosensors.The reasearch on this subject is ongiong and some breakthroughs have been made.
