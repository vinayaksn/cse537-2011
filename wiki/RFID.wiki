#summary This wiki-page explores Radio Frequency ID(RFID) and tries to analyse how it can be used for access control/inventory management options.

= Introduction =

RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification. It is a generic term used to describe a system that transmits identity of an object/person through 
wireless means/radio waves.It is basically used for tracking and identification purposes and has been widely used all over the world in libraries, shopping stores, smart cards etc.It is grouped under the broad category of automatic identification technologies.


== Automatic Identification Technologies ==

These technologies are used to automatically identify an object/person without any manual intervention. Examples of Auto-ID technologies include bar codes, optical character readers, some biometric technologies, such 
as retinal scans. 

They are used to reduce the amount of time and labor needed to input data manually and to improve data accuracy.Some auto-ID technologies - like bar code systems, require a person to manually scan a label or tag to 
capture the data. 

RFID is designed to enable readers to capture data on 
tags and transmit it to a computer system—without 
needing any manual intervention.

= Types of RFID Systems =

There are basically two types of RFID systems depending upon their frequency of operation.


== Low-frequency systems has the following characteristics: - ==

* -short reading range

* -lower system costs

* -operate on a frequency ranging from 30 KHz-500 KHz

* -commonly used in security access, asset tracking, and 
animal identification applications. 



== High-frequency systems has the following characteristics: - ==

* -offers read ranges of more than 90 feet

* -have high reading speeds

* -operate on a frequency ranging from 850-950 MHz and 2.4-
2.5 GHz

* -generally used for applications like automatic toll collection 
or railroad car tracking

* -higher performance results in higher costs

= Components of a RFID System =

The basic components of RFID are : -

* RFID tag - which is inserted in the object to be tracked.

* RFID reader - used to read the information in the tag.

An antenna is installed in the RFID tag which can transmit and receive signals which can be caught by the RFID reader. Apart from this, an IC (integrated circuit) is installed in the tag to store and process the information.

== Structure of RFID Tag ==

A RFID tag basically consists of a microchip attached to a radio 
antenna mounted on a substrate. It provides a storage capacity of 2 KB which can store information about the product or shipment like Date of manufacture, destination, selling date etc.

= Types of RFID tags =

RFID tags come in a very wide variety of shapes and sizes. Tags can be shaped according to the use. For example for identifying wooden items, tags can be screw shaped or can be in the shape of a credit card so that
they can be used in access applications. The size could be as small as a pencil lead in diameter. Such kind of RFID tags are used for tracking Animals. The merchandises in stores have an anti-theft hard plastic tag attached to it. Those tags are actually RFID tags only.

There are two types of RFID tags:-

1) Active RFID Tags: - contain a battery and therefore can transmit signals automatically and they are read/write tags i.e. the tag data can be written or modified. The memory size of active tag varies according to the requirements.

2) Passive RFID Tags: -doesn’t contain a battery and therefore are dependent on an external system for transmission of signals. They are much lighter, less expensive and have a very high lifetime as compared to the active tags. But they have a shorter range than active tags.
